# Objectives

- write in the console (error) and in a file by appending (info) using log4j2 
- use yml configuration (optionally xml configuration)
- use all logging levels

# Concepts

Slf4j is a wrapper on top of other logging frameworks.

Log4j2 is the real logging framework.

Slf4j makes the code framework agnostic.
